### IMPORTANT

This module is only an integration reference and it is the responsibility of the client to configure it and adapt it to its respective store, taking into account the particularities and conflicts that may arise during the integration process.

Frete Rápido doesn't make support integration with **Magento**, we only provide a standard integration module that caters to most e-commerces that use this platform.

For any modification to this module based on business model of your e-commerce, we hereby make available the source code of our integrated module [Frete Rápido API][9] and [this link][8] you will find the documentation for integration and modifications of **Magento**.

The Frete Rápido is not responsible for eventualities arising from this module.

#### 3. Measures and Fabrication time:

![Setting up the measurements of a product](https://freterapido.com/dev/imgs/magento_doc_english/fr_products.PNG "Setting up the measurements of a product")

> **Attention:** You need to consider the measurements and weight of product with the package ready to shipment.
> 
> It's mandatory each product has their weight configured to calculate the freight correctly. If the measurements of a product are blank, will be considered the default measures information in the setting-up of the module. But it's recommended each product has their own weight and measures informed.

#### 4. Categories
- It's important to relate each category from your store with the categories of the Frete Rápido in: Catalog> Manage Categories> Frete Rápido Categories.

![Setting up categories](https://freterapido.com/dev/imgs/magento_doc_english/fr_categories.PNG)

> **Note:** Not all categories in your store may match with the Frete Rápido categories, but you can relate them broadly.
>
> **Example 1**: Women's Clothing -> Clothing
>
> **Example 2**: CDs -> CD / DVD / Blu-Ray
